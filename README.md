# 16S-18S-ITS-ASAP
This is an automatic pipeline for analysis of amplicon sequence data including 16S, 18S and ITS. It wraps QIIME commands and complements the m with additional analysis where QIIME is not good at, such as combine multiple sequencing runs, OTU clustering and chimeric removal with UP ARSE, alignment filtering with Gblock, removing Chloroplast sequences.
